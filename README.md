Introduction:
“Thank you for the opportunity to present my analysis. Today, I’ll walk through the P-CAPE paper, explain the key points from my research, and offer a critique based on the paper’s assumptions and limitations, particularly regarding share buybacks.”

1. Summary of the P-CAPE Paper:
Dividend Payout Problem:

“The paper starts by pointing out a limitation in the traditional CAPE ratio, which is that CAPE doesn’t account for the growth of earnings reinvested into the business. The authors argue that this creates a gap between what the CAPE suggests and the true potential returns companies might generate if they reinvest their retained earnings into growth.”

“The basic idea here is that if companies reinvest their earnings instead of paying them out as dividends, they should expect a yield similar to the prevailing CAPE yield on those reinvested earnings.”

The P-CAPE Concept:

“To address this, the authors introduce P-CAPE. The idea is to improve the predictive power of the CAPE yield by adjusting for historic earnings that weren’t paid out as dividends. These earnings are compounded at the CAPE yield rate to the current date, assuming that reinvestment will lead to future growth.”

“Essentially, P-CAPE modifies the earnings time series, adjusting it for the fact that earnings were retained and supposedly invested for future growth.”

Why P-CAPE Might Be Better:

“The P-CAPE, as described, would favor companies that reinvest their earnings. The authors argue that this approach will make CAPE more predictive for companies where retained earnings are expected to result in long-term growth.”

“For instance, if you take CAPE as a point-in-time measure, it’s reasonable to assume that companies not paying dividends, especially high-growth companies, might benefit from this adjustment. Growth companies generally reinvest heavily and don’t pay dividends, so P-CAPE theoretically works in their favor.”

Why P-CAPE Might Not Be Better:

“However, there are some issues with this idea. First, just because companies don’t pay a dividend doesn’t mean they reinvest all their earnings. Companies often hold earnings as a cash buffer, reduce debts, or use the funds for share buybacks. Reinvestment is not a given.”

“Also, the companies we are talking about are listed companies that can raise capital from equity and debt markets, which often provides much more funding than what they generate in earnings in a given period.”

“Finally, growth companies often report negative earnings, and they rely on external financing to fuel their growth. P-CAPE doesn’t account for this reality, and as such, it may not be identifying the true drivers of future growth in these companies.”

2. Walkthrough of Charts and Findings:
“Now, let’s move on to the findings from my analysis.”

Chart 1: Amazon Quarterly Operating Profit & Cash Flow:

“Here we see Amazon’s quarterly operating profit over time, which has increased dramatically. However, the cash flow chart shows that while Amazon has substantial operating cash flow, much of it is reinvested back into the business, but also a significant portion is held as cash or used for share buybacks.”

“Amazon provides an interesting case because, as we know, it doesn’t pay dividends. If we used P-CAPE, it would assume that all retained earnings are reinvested into the business. But the reality, as we can see from the cash flow data, is more complex. A lot of cash is retained, but not all of it is used for reinvestment into growth.”

Chart 2: CAPE vs. P-CAPE:

“This chart compares CAPE to P-CAPE over time. As expected, P-CAPE consistently falls below CAPE, because it adjusts for retained earnings. The question is, does this lower P-CAPE number provide a better forecast of future returns?”

“In reality, the difference between CAPE and P-CAPE is relatively small across many time periods. Even though P-CAPE adjusts for retained earnings, the adjustment doesn’t result in significantly better predictability of future earnings, particularly in cases where retained earnings are not fully reinvested.”

Sector-Level Analysis:

“Looking at sector-level analysis, the difference between CAPE and P-CAPE is even smaller in sectors like Information Technology. In this sector, companies retain earnings but often use them for buybacks rather than reinvestment. This limits the potential effectiveness of P-CAPE in improving predictions for future returns.”
3. Conclusion with Focus on Buybacks:
“Finally, let’s talk about the role of buybacks, which the paper does not address explicitly.”

Note on Buybacks:

“One of the main critiques of P-CAPE is how it handles companies that buy back stock. The authors assume that all retained earnings are reinvested, but in reality, companies often use their retained earnings for buybacks rather than reinvestment. This has significant implications.”

“Buybacks increase earnings per share (EPS) by reducing the number of shares, but they don’t increase the company’s overall earnings or future growth. P-CAPE assumes reinvestment, but when a company uses retained earnings for buybacks, the benefit of that reinvestment doesn’t materialize in the same way.”

“Buybacks are often seen positively by investors because they signal that management believes the stock is undervalued. However, from a growth perspective, buybacks do not expand the company’s operations or increase future revenues or profits.”

“This creates an issue with P-CAPE, because the metric overestimates future earnings growth by assuming that retained earnings are always productively reinvested. If a company like Amazon uses its retained earnings for buybacks, the assumption that those earnings will drive future growth is flawed.”

“Traditional CAPE, on the other hand, handles buybacks better because it doesn’t assume anything about how retained earnings are used. It simply averages historical earnings and doesn’t project future growth based on assumptions about reinvestment.”

Closing:
“In summary, while P-CAPE provides an interesting adjustment for retained earnings, it doesn’t account for companies that use buybacks instead of reinvestment. This leads to an overestimation of future growth in companies that prioritize buybacks, making P-CAPE less effective in practice than traditional CAPE, especially for companies that engage heavily in share repurchases.

Thank you for your attention, and I’d be happy to discuss this further.”
